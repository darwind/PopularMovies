The app uses an API key from www.tmdb.org
You will need to create an account to acquire an API key yourself.

The API key should go into the MoviesAsyncTaskLoader as that is the only place where the API key is used.

Look at line 51 where it needs to be inserted instead of the text [insert API key here].

I haven't specified the key as a static variable as it's generally bad practice for security reasons to store private keys in either static fields or the Strings.xml for instance.
